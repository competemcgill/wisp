# Users

The purpose of this microservice is to manage all logic relating to users and to privide OAuth2.0-compliant authorization endpoints. Since WISP allows users to solve problems across multiple sites (such as Codeforces and Katis), it is this microservice's role to collect and keep the user's information in-sync across all sites.

## Getting Started

### For Development

**Requirements**

* [`docker`](https://www.docker.com/)
* [`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

**Available Commands**

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm start` | spins up a MongoDB instance as well as your API server through docker-compose (see docker-compose.yaml). Be sure that ports 27017 and 3000 are unused by other services |
| `npm run start:local` | runs a nodemon server that listens for changes in the src directory (requires nodemon and ts-node) |
| `npm run start:prod` | starts the API server in the production env. Must be run after `npm run build` (requires node and tsc) |
| `npm run test` | runs unit tests on new instances of MongoDB and the API (see docker-compose.test.yaml). Once the tests finish running, both instances stop 
| `npm run test:local` | runs unit tests without docker and MongoDB (requires nyc, mocha, and ts-node) |
| `npm run build` | builds the API for production and outputs the result in dist/ (requires tsc) |
| `npm run lint` | lints the src directory according to tslint.json and tsconfig.json |


**Running**

Clone the [repository](https://github.com/Compete-McGill/wisp-users-microservice), and navigate to the root of the project.

Then run:

```bash
npm i
npm start
```

see `npm start` in Available Commands
